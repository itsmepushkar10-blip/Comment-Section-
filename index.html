            <h1>The Choice Dilemma</h1>
            <p><em>A reflection on consciousness, ego, and the choices that define us.</em></p>
        </header>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Whatever we are today is nothing but a result of choices made at different stages of our life. Something that keeps humans a little ahead of other species is their level of consciousness.</p>
            
            <p>Prior to the battle of Kurukshetra, Sakuni advised Duryodhan to seek help from Dwaraka. Seeking help from Shri Krishna was something that Duryodhan's ego resisted, but being worried about the involvement of Dwaraka, he agreed.</p>
            
            <p>Duryodhan reached Dwarka and so did Arjun. Seeing Krishna resting in his room, Duryodhan sat next to Shri Krishna waiting for him to awake. Meanwhile Arjun enters into the sleeping room and remains standing in humble reverence beside the feet of the almighty.</p>
            
            <p>The seeking of help from the almighty comes with the condition. And that condition, the dissolve of ego and surrender. The body language of Arjun is the reflection of that condition, but Duryodhan's perhaps not.</p>

            <p>In reality, whenever we have gone to seek help we have seeked Narayani Sena not the Narayan himself. But it was not so with Parth. He rejected every 999 means to get only one complete means. One complete means that awakens him from his low during his biggest battle.</p>
